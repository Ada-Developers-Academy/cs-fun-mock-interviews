# About Mock Interviews

As part of Thursdays at Ada, you are required to complete five peer-to-peer mock interviews on topics covered in both the Classroom and Thursdays at Ada phases of CS Fundamentals. 

Mock interviews should be conducted in 90 minute sessions. Pairs should take approximately 10 minutes to choose questions for each other and read over the provided solutions for their partner's problem. Then each participant should take turns posing as interviewer and interviewee. Each person should have about 40 minutes to attempt their question.

During these sessions, please make an effort to treat it as if it were a real interview space. While we recognize this may feel uncomfortable, learning goals for mock interviews include not only practicing CS Fundamentals topics in an interview setting, but also learning to sit with the discomfort and anxiety that often accompanies interviews. That being said, mock interviews are a _practice_ space. Leave room to make mistakes, ask questions, and learn from your partner. 

Feel free to optionally add a behavioral question at the top of the interview. If a partner finishes early, consider discussing time and space complexity and/or completing one of the challenges offered at the bottom of the solution guide. You may also choose to leave the session early if you both finish before the 90 minute time mark. 

We encourage you not to extend past 90 minutes as real technical interviews will be time boxed. If you do not complete your question, that's 100% okay and very common for a technical interview! Feel free to finish the problem on your own time if interested. 

## Graduation Requirements

To graduate, you must complete 5 mock interviews. Over the span of the five interviews you must
- Have at least three different interview partners
- Complete interviews in at least three different topics
- Use Ada provided questions

After each mock interview, please submit a mock interview retrospective via the Learn checkpoints we have provided you. 

The variety of partners requirement is to encourage you to experience different styles of interviewers and observe different folks' problem solving strategies. The variety of topics requirement is to encourage you to practice multiple topics that may arise when you begin your job search.

## Mock Interview Questions

[**Mock Interview Question Repository**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmKIpGL_z_IXhgLiaGAf3kPc_bApgH1LtIGcXVoKUHE/edit?usp=sharing)

For your five required mock interviews, we ask that you use Ada provided questions from the linkabove. This is to ensure questions are of an appropriate scope and topic. We encourage you to explore non-Ada interview questions in your own time!

**DO NOT VIEW THE PROBLEMS BEFOREHAND** In order to simulate a real interview experience, please do not preview the questions beforehand. 

When you enter the mock interview, you may choose one or more topics for your interviewer to select your question from. The topics are:
- Classroom Topics
- Dynamic Programming
- Linked Lists
- Binary Search Trees
- Graphs - Breadth First & Depth First Search
- Graphs - Dijkstra's

We encourage partners to select a question from the interviewee's chosen topic(s) at random from the following repository:


## Reminders
- It's **100% okay** not to finish the problem in the allotted time. 
- Your solution does not have to match the sample solution. There are many ways to solve these problems!
  - Because we cannot anticipate every possible solution, the sample solution only provides one possible solution
  - If you are an interviewer and are unsure how to help your interviewee because they are choosing an approach that does not match the sample solution, that's okay! Industry interviewers are sometimes unable or unwilling to provide assistance to the interviewee in a real mock. You may also consider looking up alternative solutions online.
- It's okay if you struggle to find a starting point and make progress towards a solution. Consider how you can still show your interviewer what you do know and present yourself in a positive light. 
  - Is there a subproblem or similar problem you can make progress towards solving?
  - Can you develop a set of tests (input/output) to demonstrate your understanding of the problem?
  - Can you pseudocode a solution or partial solution?
  - Consider asking if your interviewer is willing to engage in a collaborative approach
  - There is still value in sitting through an interview where you have no idea how to approach the problem and coming out the other end!
- Be kind to each other! Wherever possible, help your partner with hints as needed.
- **Remember**: At the bottom of the solution repls there is extra information for the interviewer. It contains:
  - Answers to clarifying questions your partner might ask
  - Suggestions on hints you can give if needed
